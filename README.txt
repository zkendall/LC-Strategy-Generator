# Project's Pre-History#
I began this idea in December 2012, originally writing in Java. I knew I needed a database for it, and I didn't want to wait until I took a database class, so I taught myself SQL and tried out many differ Java implementations of it. At the time, over Christmas break, I started teaching myself Python, because I saw it as a popular and versatile language. I switched the project over to Python because I was loving Python, and wanted a project outside of Java, which I was using for all my school projects.
