After getting it to work in console mode, I've been developing a UI for the app.

To Do:
- Fix the ROI calclulation
- Add all filter options. Currently I've only added a few filters and options, just enough to see if things work.
- Get threading to work both with generator and with database building from CSV.




# Project's Pre-History #

I began this idea in December 2012, originally writing in Java. I knew I needed a database for it, and I didn't want to wait until I took a database class, so I taught myself SQL and tried out many differ Java implementations of it. At the time, over Christmas break, I started teaching myself Python, because I saw it as a popular and versatile language. I switched the project over to Python because I was loving Python, and wanted a project outside of Java, which I was using for all my school projects.
